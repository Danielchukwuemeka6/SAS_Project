PROJECT I : Statistical Analysis of the faecal composition of Dairy Cows (Experimental values Vs Validation values)

  OBJECTIVE/AIM
  The Aim of this project is to carry out statistical analysis between 3 different farms and determine the if there is significant difference betweent the mean of the different farms and as well as it's mean difference.
The following was carried out during the analysis
1.) Descriptive analysis of each variable (Dry matter content (DM),Ash Content (ASH), Neutral Detergent Fibre (NDF), Nitrogen (N).) was determined.
2.) Regression analysis to determine the correlation coefficient between the experimental and predicted values.
3.) Visualization by creating a scatter plot of experimental and predicted values.
4.) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), to determine the if there is significan difference between the farms. Also Turkey test was used for post HOC test as to determine the mean difference if there exist significant difference.
